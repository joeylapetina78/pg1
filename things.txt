in the command pallet you do:
Python: Create Enviorment

something that came with Python that creates an envronment in a directory.
I forget what the -m was for, venv is the tokol and env is the name of
the folder all the enviroment stuff will be put in. 
-m venv env 

#This is supposed to start the env. It is not throwing an error. but I am not sure its working.
env\Scripts\activate.bat
So the reason it wasnt working was becuase vs code takes care of all of
that for me when you come in to the folder its this env
